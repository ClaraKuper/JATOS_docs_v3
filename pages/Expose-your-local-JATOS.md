More information about how to [bring your JATOS online](Bring-your-JATOS-online.html)

On this page we will describe how to expose your locally installed JATOS to the Internet by using tunneling services. If you want to know a bit more about the background, I recommend reading [Tunnelling services for exposing localhost to the web](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/tunnelling-services-for-exposing-localhost-to-the-web). There are several of those and some of those are free or have a free offer. We concentrate here on Serveo, ngrok, and Localtunnel.

- leave computer with JATOS running as long as you want your participants to access it
- reliability: internet connection reset, accidental unplugging your computer during vacuuming 
- Encrypted
- easy to use, fast
- URL you can share with your participants

## Serveo

1. Run JATOS locally 

https://serveo.net/

  - little less delay (faster)
  - easier in use (if you know how SSH)

## ngrok

https://ngrok.com/

## Localtunnel
