Cortex is a running JATOS server where you can try out JATOS in the Internet instead of your local computer:

[https://cortex.jatos.org](https://cortex.jatos.org) (log in with _test@jatos.org_ and _abc1234_)

This is a normal JATOS installation with many example studies already imported. You can run the examples or import your own studies if you want to test them in a JATOS running in an online environment. 

But be aware that every day **this JATOS server will be reset** to its inital state and all changes will be lost. In other words this JATOS is not meant to run your studies online.
