JATOS (Just Another Tool for Online Studies) helps you set up and run your online studies on your own server.

This is the documentation for JATOS 3 - Are you looking for the docs of [JATOS 2](http://v2.jatos.org/Whats-JATOS.html)?

We have a page that covers all about [migrating from JATOS 2 to 3](Migrate-from-v2-to-v3.html).

### JATOS at a glance: 
* Run studies on your **own server**. This means that you keep complete control over who can access your result data and can comply with your ethics.
* Studies run on **mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and lab computers** - any device with a browser.
* Use tools like **jsPsych**, **lab.js**, **OSWeb/OpenSesame**, or **PsyToolkit** to prepare your study - or write all **HTML / JavaScript / CSS** yourself and have full control.
* **Run group studies** where multiple workers interact with each other in real-time.
* Itâ€™s GUI-based, so there's no need to use the terminal to talk to your server. 
* Recruit participants via **Amazon Mechanical Turk**, **Prolific** etc.
* It's **open-source and free** to use.
* **Manage workers**, to e.g. make sure that each participant does your study only **once**.
* **Export/Import** studies to facilitate exchange with other researchers.

You can try out [JATOS on _cortex_, our test server](JATOS-Tryout-Server.html).
