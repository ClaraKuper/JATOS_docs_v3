JATOS (Just Another Tool for Online Studies) helps you set up and run your online studies on your own server.

This is the Documentation for JATOS 3 - Are you looking for the docs of [JATOS 2](http://v2.jatos.org/Whats-JATOS.html)?

### JATOS at a glance: 
* Run studies on your **own server**. This means that you keep complete control over who can access your result data and can comply with your ethics.
* Studies run on **mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and lab computers** - any device with a browser.
* Write your studies in **HTML / JavaScript / CSS** - you have full control over what runs in the browser. 
* **Run group studies** where multiple workers interact with each other in real-time.
* Itâ€™s GUI-based, so there's no need to use the terminal to talk to your server. 
* Connect to the **[Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com)** to recruit participants.
* It's **open-source and free** to use.
* Manage workers, to e.g. make sure that each participant does your study only once.
* **Export/Import** studies to facilitate exchange with other researchers.
