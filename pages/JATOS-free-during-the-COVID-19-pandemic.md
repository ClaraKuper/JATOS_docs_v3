summary: During the COVID-19 pandemic many scientists can't proceed with their usual lab experiments anymore and move to online versions of their studies. But setting up a JATOS instance is not always easy. We want to support the scientific community by providing a JATOS server for free.

The link to the JATOS server is at the end of the page. But first the playing rules:

### Playing rules

**Time frame**

For now we plan to offer this server until the end of August 2020. 

**Please talk to us before you run your study with participants if**

* you want to run a study with many participants at the same time (e.g. send out a link by Twitter, Facebook etc.)
* you have high data volume (> 1 MB per component) in your result data or result files of your study
* you want to upload audio/video in your study

All these will increase the traffic, and therefore the server costs, so please just check with us that it's within our budget. 

**Privacy and ethics**

* This JATOS server is hosted in the cloud (Digital Ocean), within the European Union and uses encryption for all network traffic. That said, you should check whether a cloud-hosted server complies to the ethics regulation of your institution.
* _experiments.jatos.org_ or JATOS itself does not store user information apart from what is necessary to create the user account (username, name).
* More can be found under: [http://www.jatos.org/Data-Privacy-and-Ethics.html](http://www.jatos.org/Data-Privacy-and-Ethics.html)

**Backup your result data**

Right now _experiments.jatos.org_ is backed up only on a weekly basis. Please export your result data on a regular basis since otherwise in some (hopefully never happening) server failure your data might get lost. Sadky, we will most likely not have the capacity to help you troubleshoot or recover lost data.  

**Research only**

No private use, no commercial use.

**Support us**

The server costs money. Please consider donating via buymeacoffee.com (coffee cup on the bottom right).
