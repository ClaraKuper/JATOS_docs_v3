Each study has a log in JATOS.

* Usually not neccessary - only if doubts occure it's nice to have
* What is logged: create/delete study, run study, save/delete/export results
* Hashes for results (saving, deleting, exporting), SHA-256, proves integrity
* Only as save as the server on which JATOS is running
