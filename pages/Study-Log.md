From version 3.2.1 onwards JATOS stores a log file for each study. This file has line for every event that happened in a study, most importantly when a component- or study-result was logged or deleted. Also, it contains a hash -- a string that is generated by the contents of the result data itself. This, in principle, would allow any JATOS user to show that the data have not been modified, and that no result was deleted between data collection and publication. 

You can see the log by clicking on More -> Log within the Study bar. And it looks like this:

A few more details:
* The study log won't be necessary in most cases. Just nice to have. Just in case.  
* The following events are logged: create/delete study, run study, save/delete/export results. 
* And of course a hash (SHA-25) for the cumulative results (i.e., the full study result data). Because the hash changes if a result is deleted, this can prove data integrity if it is questioned. 
* The study log is only as safe as the server on which JATOS is running. Anybody with access to the server can potentially modify the study log file and e.g. hide that data has been deleted. We can't prevent this, so it's important to have a safe server that only admins can access. 
* The study log is in JSON format. Pretty in the screenshot above, raw in the one below.
