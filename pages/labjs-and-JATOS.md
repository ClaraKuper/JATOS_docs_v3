[lab.js](https://lab.js.org/) is an easy to use tool to create online experiments. Their [Builder](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/) makes creating an online experiment a piece of cake - although if you like to code yourself lab.js' supports this too.

lab.js and JATOS fit perfectly together: create your experiment with lab.js and then put it online and let it run by particpants with JATOS. And the best: **lab.js directly exports JATOS studies**. So you just import your studies into JATOS and can run them online.

lab.js already has a [great documentation](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and one page their is solely dedicated to JATOS: [Collecting data with JATOS](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/deploy/3c-jatos.html?highlight=jatos).

That's all there is to say.
