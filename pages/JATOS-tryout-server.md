Cortex is a running JATOS server where you can try out JATOS in the Internet instead of your local computer.

[https://cortex.jatos.org](https://cortex.jatos.org)

Log in with _test@jatos.org_ and _abc123_.

This is a normal JATOS installation with many example studies already imported. You can run the examples or import your own studies if you want to test them in a JATOS running in an online environment. 

But be aware that every day **at 8:00 UTC this JATOS server will be reset** to its inital state and all changes will be lost. With other words this JATOS is not meant to run your studies online. If you want to your own JATOS server online have a look at [Install JATOS on a server](JATOS-on-a-server.html).
