Easy admins and semi-admins


[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) that is comparatively easy to use and has good and exhaustive documentation. They offer something called _Droplets_ and _One-Click Apps_ which is just a fancy name for a pre-installed server in the cloud.

**Danger: Will cost money. A server in the cloud doesn't come for free. And you will need a credit card!**

## Prerequisites

You need to get an account with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

## Setup a simple JATOS server on DigitalOcean

1. Use this [link](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=docker-18-04) to create a Droplet with Ubuntu and Docker pre-installed. Do not press _Create_ yet - we need to set up things first.


   Your sreen should look similar to this one: Selected One-Click App with Docker on Ubuntu
   
1. Scroll down to _Choose a size_: JATOS usually runs fine with 1 GB memory and 1 CPU - so the smallest size usually enough (currently it cost $5/month)

1. Scroll down to _Choose region_: You can actually choose any, but best is to choose one that is near to your participants to reduce loading time.

1. _Select additional options_: Here activate **User Data** and add the following script in the text field

   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Run JATOS as docker container
   docker pull jatos/jatos:latest
   docker run -d --restart=always -p 80:9000 jatos/jatos:latest
   ```

1. Optional one can an SSH key under _Add your SSH keys_. If you don't know what this is or don't want to, just ignore this - you will still be able to access the server.

1. Finally click the _Create_ button

1. Try out your JATOS: Now the server is being created which can take a couple seconds. You should get an email from DigitalOcean with your server's (aka Droplet) name, IP address, username and password. Copy the IP to your browser and if everything went well you will see a JATOS login screen.

1. Although not necessary you can access your server via SSH `ssh root@xx.xx.xx.xx` (exchange xx.xx.xx.xx with your IP). The first time it will ask you to change your password.

**Voila, you have your own JATOS server.**

Now you might want to use a nicer address than an IP and add some encryption-safety with HTTPS to your server - then read on.


## Add HTTPS with Traefik and use your own domain name

This part is optional and is only necessary if you want to have your own domain name instead of an IP and use encryption (HTTPS).

We will use [Traefik](https://traefik.io/). Traefik adds encryption out-of-the-box (by using [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)). Traefik is [open source](https://github.com/containous/traefik) and free to use. 

**Buy your own domain name**: Sorry, we can't give you a domain name - you have to get your own. But there are plenty [domain name registrars that help you with this business](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars). Another option is to talk to your IT department and convince them to give you a subdomain for free.

Now with a domain name you can encrypt your server's communication with HTTPS (HTTPS works only with a domain name and not with just an IP).

To create a JATOS server with Traefik follow the instructions in the first paragraph [Setup a simple JATOS server on DigitalOcean](#setup-a-simple-jatos-server-on-digitalocean) but in the **User Data** field of _Select additional options_ add the following script:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

DOMAIN_NAME="my.domain.name"
EMAIL="my.email@foo.com"

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JATOS/JATOS/master/deploy/docker-compose.yaml > /root/docker-compose.yaml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JATOS/JATOS/master/deploy/traefik.toml > /root/traefik.toml

sed -i "s/<DOMAIN_NAME>/${DOMAIN_NAME}/g" /root/docker-compose.yaml
sed -i "s/<DOMAIN_NAME>/${DOMAIN_NAME}/g" /root/traefik.toml
sed -i "s/<EMAIL>/${EMAIL}/g" /root/traefik.toml

touch /root/acme.json
chmod 600 /root/acme.json
docker network create proxy
docker-compose -f /root/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

Exchange `my.domain.name` and `my.email@foo.com` with your own domain name and email address.

This script downloads two config files, one for Traefik and one for Docker Compose. If you are interested you can see them under https://github.com/JATOS/JATOS/blob/master/deploy/docker-compose.yaml and https://github.com/JATOS/JATOS/blob/master/deploy/traefik.toml. Docker Compose will start JATOS' and Traefik's container for us.

After you've created your Droplet you still have to point your domain name to your server's IP address. This involves dealing with things like _A records_ or _AAAA records_ or _DNS_ servers and simply can be quite annoying. You can [manage your DNS settings with Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records/) or the registar where you got your domain name (they will have some online help). The important thing is to put the the IPv4 address of your server into the _A record_ of your DNS settings (or if you have an IPv6 address the _AAAA record_). And remember, DNS changes can take from some minutes to a day to propagate throughout the Internet - So your domain name might take some time to work (you can use [nslookup](http://www.kloth.net/services/nslookup.php) to check).

Then as a last step, after your domain name points to your server's IP, you have to reset your server (switch off the droplet and back on). Now Traefik can request a certificate for your domain and use HTTPS from now on.
