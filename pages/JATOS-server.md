# Bring your JATOS online

| | Setup time | Setup difficulty | Cost | Number of JATOS user / JATOS workers | Expected running time span  | Reliability | Privacy |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Expose Local JATOS** | fast | easy | none | you / many [^3] | hours to days | medium to low | as good as your computer |
| **Cloud Server** | fast (an hour) if you have some admin skills | depends on your cloud vendor | yes | few / many [^1] | hours to years | high | medium |
| **Own Server** | depending on your IT department (can take time) | needs admin skills | ask your IT department | many / many [^1] | month to years | high | high [^2] |

[^1]: depends on your server size 
[^2]: if HTTPS is used
[^3]: depends on our computer size and internet connection


## Fast & easy: expose your local JATOS to the Internet

This is the easiest, but also least reliable way. If you just want to run an experiment online for a couple of hours or days, but it's not extremly dramatic if things break - this one is for you.

## Cloud server

Can be still fast & easy (depending on your cloud vendor and your skills), but might not be in line with your privacy rules (TODO wording). This one is reliable and can run for a long time (as long as you pay). And it can serve many JATOS users.

## Own server

A JATOS installation at your institute is probably the safest and most reliable way - but also the one that (usually) takes the longest time to setup.
