Each experimenter with access to the JATOS server (though the GUI) is a JATOS User. Users can create, modify and delete the studies they are members of.
They can also export and delete results. Users may also have admin rights, which lets them control other users' access to JATOS. 

**Manage users**

JATOS (v3.1.1 and later) comes with one default user: Admin. Admin always has admin rights that cannot be revoked. The password for this user should be kept safe!
Admins can create new user (and manage existing users), by clicking on the 'User Manager' button on the top bar (only visible to admin users).

New users can be granted admin rights, by checking the corresponding box.

Admins can see a list of users, to grant or revoke admin rights and to delete them if necessary. **Be careful when deleting users! 
This will delete all studies, along with their result data, that this user is the single member of.**

Finally, admins can also change the password of non-admin users. To change the password you'll need to enter your own (Admin) password, along with the new desired password for the user.
