OSWeb an online runtime for [OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.2/) experiments. OpenSesame is a program to create experiments for psychology, neuroscience, and experimental economics.

[OSWeb's documentation](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.2/manual/osweb/) is actually far better than ours can ever be. So we just say that it's pretty easy to combine OSWeb with JATOS: just export the experiment in OSWeb and import it in JATOS.

That's all there is to say.
