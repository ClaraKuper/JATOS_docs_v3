You might want to assign different conditions of your experiment to different participants. Perhaps because you want to counterbalance your conditions across participants to acount for order effects. Another reason might be that you want to run a between-participants design. 

In order to do that, you need to keep track of how many participants did each of your possible conditions. That means that you need to store the participants count somewhere that outlives each study run. You can use the Batch Session data for this. 


Have a look at the ["Randomize tasks between workers"](Example-Studies.html) study in our examples for the full code.
