    <h2 id="results-pages">Results Pages</h2>

<p>Once you collected data for a study, you can see and manage the results by clicking on one of the <em>Results</em> buttons.</p>

<p><img src="images/ResultsLink.png" alt="Results Link" /></p>

<p>The image below is an example of a study results page. There’s quite a lot of information here, so we’ll go through each piece.</p>

<p><img src="images/ResultsView Screenshot2.png" alt="Results View screenshot" /></p>

<h2 id="interacting-with-the-results-table">Interacting With The Results Table</h2>

<h3 id="view-result-data">View Result Data</h3>

<p>Each study result has an arrow on the left. If you click on it, the result data for this study run will be displayed underneath the row. Since a study can have several components and each component produces its own result data there can be several result data each in its own row (like in the screenshot below).</p>

<p><img src="images/ResultsView Screenshot3.png" alt="Results View screenshot" /></p>

<h3 id="selecting-results">Selecting Results</h3>

<p>Prior to JATOS version 3.3.1 you could select/deselect a specific result by clicking anywhere on the row. Selected results change color to dark blue.</p>

<p>From 3.3.1 on there is a checkbox on the left side of each row.</p>

<p>You can also use the buttons on the bar above to select/deselect all results in the table or select only all filtered ones.</p>

<h3 id="filter-results">Filter Results</h3>

<p>The filter lets you search all all fields in the results table (the metadata) and from JATOS version 3.3.1 on also in the result data themselves.</p>

<p>If you type, for example, “Personal Single” in the <em>Filter Results</em> field, only the results ran by a Personal Single worker will appear on the table. You can then click on <em>Select Filtered</em> to select and then export only those results that you’re interested in.</p>

<h3 id="export-result-data">Export Result Data</h3>

<p>Once you selected the results you’re interested in, click <em>Export Results</em> and your browser will download a text file that contains your results in whatever format (text, csv, json) you stored them. Then read this text file with SPSS, Excel, Matlab, R or whatever program you use to analyze results.</p>

<h3 id="export-metadata-jatos-version--331">Export Metadata (JATOS version &gt;= 3.3.1)</h3>

<p>Sometimes one is also interested in the metadata, that is what’s in the actual table fields (“Result ID”, “Start Time” , “Last Seen”, …). For this click on <em>Export Metadata</em> and the metadata of the selected results will be downloaded in CSV format.</p>

<h3 id="delete-results">Delete Results</h3>

<p>You can click <em>Delete</em> to remove all or only some selected results (result data + metadata). Keep in mind <strong>there’s no undo function for this</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="table-columns">Table Columns</h2>

<p>You can show and hide the columns displayed in the table with the drop-down menu under the <em>Display Columns</em> button.</p>

<h3 id="result-id">Result ID</h3>
<p>An identifier assigned by JATOS to each study result. A study result is actually a set of component results, each of them with their own (different) <em>Component Result ID</em>.</p>

<h3 id="start-time">Start Time</h3>
<p>Time (set at the server’s time zone) at which the first component of the study was started.</p>

<h3 id="end-time">End Time</h3>
<p>Time (set at the server’s time zone) at which the last component of the study was finished.</p>

<h3 id="last-seen">Last Seen</h3>
<p>Each component running in a worker’s browser sends a “heartbeat” regularly back to JATOS. Last Seen is the time of the last heartbeat received. The heartbeat stops either when the study is finished or when the browser tab is closed. The default period of the heartbeat is 2 minutes but you can change it through a <a href="jatos.js-Reference.html#jatossetheartbeatperiodheartbeatperiod">jatos.js function</a>.</p>

<h3 id="duration">Duration</h3>
<p>Simply the time difference between the start and end time.</p>

<h3 id="batch">Batch</h3>
<p>Name of the batch the worker belongs to.</p>

<h3 id="worker-id">Worker ID</h3>
<p>Assigned by JATOS. Each worker has its own Worker ID. JATOS’ admin user will always have Worker ID 1. You can click on a Worker ID to see all the worker’s results.</p>

<h3 id="worker-type">Worker Type</h3>
<p>Displays the <a href="Worker-Types.html">Worker type</a> that ran the study.</p>

<h3 id="mturk-worker-id-confirmation-code">MTurk Worker ID (Confirmation Code)</h3>
<p>Only applies to studies run by MTurk workers. An identifier given by Amazon Mechanical Turk’s, not by JATOS. The Confirmation Code is generated by JATOS and given to the worker as proof of his work.</p>

<h3 id="group-id">Group ID</h3>
<p>Only available for group studies. It identifies the group.</p>

<h3 id="state">State</h3>

<p>Possible states for study results are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PRE - <a href="Worker-Types.html#preview-links">Preview of study</a> (exists only in PersonalSingleWorker and GeneralSingleWorker)</li>
  <li>STARTED - Study was started</li>
  <li>DATA_RETRIEVED - Study’s jsonData were retrieved</li>
  <li>FINISHED - Study successfully finished</li>
  <li>ABORTED - Study aborted by worker</li>
  <li>FAIL - Something went wrong</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible states for component results are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>STARTED - Component was started</li>
  <li>DATA_RETRIEVED - Component’s jsonData were retrieved</li>
  <li>RESULTDATA_POSTED - Result data were posted</li>
  <li>FINISHED - Component was finished</li>
  <li>RELOADED - Component was reloaded</li>
  <li>ABORTED - Component aborted by worker</li>
  <li>FAIL - Something went wrong</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="messages">Messages</h3>
<p>A message that can be set together with <a href="jatos.js-Reference.html#jatosendstudysuccessful-message">jatos.endStudy</a> or <a href="jatos.js-Reference.html#jatosabortstudymessage">jatos.abortStudy</a>.</p>
