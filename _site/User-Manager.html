    <p>Each experimenter with access to the JATOS server (though the GUI) is a JATOS User. Users can create, modify and delete the studies they are members of.
They can also export and delete results. Users may also have <strong>admin rights</strong>, which lets them control other users’ access to JATOS.</p>

<p><strong>Manage users</strong></p>

<p>Only users with admin rights have access to the <strong>User Manager</strong> (located in the header on every GUI page). In the User Manager an admin can create new user, change password of other users, or delete other users.</p>

<p>JATOS comes with one user out-of-box: <strong>Admin</strong> (with user name ‘admin’). Admin always has admin rights that cannot be revoked. The initial password for Admin is ‘admin’ should be changed immediately after installation and kept safe!</p>

<p>Additional to the Admin user every other user can be granted admin rights too (although they can be revoked later).</p>

<p>New users can be granted admin rights, by checking the corresponding box.</p>

<p>Admins can see a list of users, to grant or revoke admin rights and to delete them if necessary. <strong>Be careful when deleting users! 
This will delete all studies, along with their result data, that this user is the single member of.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, admins can also change the password of other users. To change the password you’ll need to enter your own (admin) password, along with the new desired password for the user.</p>
